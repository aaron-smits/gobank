# gobank

This project stems from a tutorial I found from [Anthony GG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwZuNmAzaH8)

I also referenced [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p08c0-99SyU) to learn more about Docker and docker-compose.

My main goal with this project is the build a basic JSON API with Go to understand how Go works and the idioms its developers use.


On the to do list:
- [ ] Transfer endpoint
- [ ] Logout endpoint
- [ ] Method to invalidate JWT tokens
- [ ] Create a client UI using Go html templates or HTMX
- [ ] Deploy a demo version
